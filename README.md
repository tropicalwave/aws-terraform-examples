# Collection of AWS examples using Terraform

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/tropicalwave/aws-terraform-examples/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

See the subdirectories for documentation of specific examples.

Generally, it should be sufficient to switch into the
subdirectories and execute the following commands to
start deployments:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The deployments can later be destroyed by the
execution of `terraform destroy`.
